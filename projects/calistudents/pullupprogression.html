                        Step by step guide to achieving your first pull-up
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        The pull-up is one of the most important exercises for your upper body - not many exercise come
                        close to the benefits of the pull-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether your main form of exercise is weight training or calisthenics - or perhaps you just work
                        out at home when you have the time
                        - the pull-up should be included in your workout - it's essential for all levels of fitness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said - it is a more "advanced" exercise simply because of the strength needed to
                        perform them with good form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Luckily for everyone there is an abundance of progression exercises you can do to replace - and
                        eventually build your way up to - the standard pull-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's begin with the first progression:
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="auspullup">
                        The Australian pull-up
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        No - despite its name you won't be hanging upside down - so don't get too excited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Australian pull-up is the perfect progression exercise
                        because you can increase or decrease the difficulty level simply by changing your foot
                        placement.
                        <br> Simply put - your grandma can follow along.
                    </p>

                                    alt="Image of a person performing an Australian pull-up">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Keep at these until you can do 10 repetitions of the smallest incline - And don't worry if you
                        think you're ready and it ends up being too hard -
                        just go back to the previous progression. No shame in that.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Dead Hangs</h2>
                    <img src="images/article-image-dead-hang.jpg" alt="Image of a person performing a Dead Hang">
                    <p>
                        Dead Hangs are a great way to get you used to hanging on the bar - and they train your forearms
                        and grip a lot.<br>
                        They also lead directly into the next progression:
                    </p>
                    <h2>Scapula Shrugs</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the scapula shrugs you want to hang in a straight line with a tight grip and your knuckles
                        facing up.<br>
                        You're basically going from a dead hang to an active hang - and then back again.
                    </p>
                    <div class="progressionshowcase">

                        </div>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Retract your scapulas - and then relax them. Do this until you can perform 10 repetitions.<br>
                        Then go on to the next progression:
                    </p>
                    <h2>Active Hang</h2>
                    <p>
                        Just like you did in the previous progression - retract your scapulas - but instead of relaxing
                        them afterwards you keep them retracted.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/article-image-active-hang.jpg" alt="Image of a person performing an Active Hang">
                    <p>
                        Keep working at this until you can hold an active hang for a 45 full seconds.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        The jump negative pull-up
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        This is going to be the last progression before the standard pull-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The jump negative pull-up sounds a little confusing - but don't worry - it's pretty simple.
                    </p>

                                    alt="Image of a person performing an Australian pull-up">
                                <figcaption><i>Slowly descend</i></figcaption>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The idea is you use the momentum from your jump to get to the top position of a pull-up -
                        and come back down as slow as you can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then you jump again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep doing jumping negative pull-ups - as you get better and stronger you'll be able to use less
                        and less momentum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This will eventually turn into your first pull-up.
