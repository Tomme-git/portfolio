                        5 Upper Body Exercises to MASTER Calisthenics
                    </h1>

                    <p>
                        Being able to do a <a href=#>muscle-up</a> - or perhaps a <a href="#">full planche push-up</a>
                        - shows incredible strength and requires immense amounts of dedication to achieve. <br> But they
                        can be achieved for free.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You’ve probably thought to yourself: <q>Man, I’d love to be able to do that</q> - but the goal
                        seems
                        huge and most likely impossible to achieve.<br> Of course, it does. <br>No human should be able
                        to defy
                        gravity like that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like with every huge task, breaking them into much smaller tasks - and then those smaller tasks
                        into
                        even smaller tasks - is a great way of accomplishing your goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m going to show you five upper body calisthenics exercises. <br>If you master these five
                        fundamentals,
                        you’ll be able to master all aspects of calisthenics. <br>- That even includes building your way
                        up to your
                        first muscle-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember - It’s a marathon, not a race. Set small goals for yourself and achieve your main goal
                        step by step.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are three main aspects of calisthenics: pushing, pulling, and holding.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example - in pulling - the first progression most people will start off with is the <a
                            href="pullupprogression.html#auspullup"> Australian pull up.</a><br>
                        Over time it will turn into jumping pull ups, then into pull ups, then into high pull ups, and
                        so on. <br>This is called <b><a href="#">progressive overload;</a></b> progressively making your
                        exercise harder in order
                        to become stronger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This leads us to our first exercise:
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="one">
                        1. Pull-ups
                    </h2>
                    <img src="images/article-image-pullup.jpg" alt="Image of a person performing a pull-up">
                    <p>
                        As with most calisthenics exercises - the pull-up is a compound movement - this means that you
                        use
                        many different muscles at once to perform the movement.<br><br> The pull-up is the ultimate form
                        of
                        compound movement, it uses nearly every muscle in your upper body with the main focus being the
                        back muscles.

                    <h2 id="two">
                        2. Push-ups
                    </h2>
                    <img src="images/article-image-pushup.jpg" alt="Image of a person performing a push-up">
                    <p>
                        This one's a classic - even the most esteemed athletes have this exercise in their workout
                        routine. <br><br>
                        The push-up is also a compound movement - but instead of focusing on the back - this exercise
                        focuses on the chest and triceps.
                    </p>
                    <p><a href="#">Want to learn how to perform your first push-up?</a></p>
                    <h2 id="three">
                        3. Dips
                    </h2>
                    <img src="images/article-image-dip.jpg" alt="Image of a person performing a straight bar dip">
                    <p>
                        The dip is the counterpart to the pull-up - instead of pulling your entire weight - you push
                        it.<br><br>
                        You might be thinking: <q>well why would you need to do push-ups then?</q><br>
                        And you're right, the dip and the push-up work the same muscles - although with different
                        focuses.<br><br>
                        But part of mastering your upper body is mastering all three directions: Up, forward, and down.
                    </p>
                    <p><a href="#">Want to learn how to perform your first dip?</a></p>
                    <h2 id="four">
                        4. L-sit hold
                    </h2>
                    <img src="images/article-image-l-sit-hold.jpg" alt="Image of a person performing an L-sit hold">
                    <p>
                        The L-sit hold seems easy at first glance - but once you get on the bar (or the floor) and
                        attempt it you learn just how weak
                        your core is.<br><br> The L-sit hold is the fundamental hold exercise of calisthenics. <br>It
                        trains your core immensely.
                        And without a strong core most of the other exercises will be much harder. <br><br>So get those
                        L-sits going.
                    </p>
                    <p><a href="#">Want to learn how to perform your first L-sit hold?</a></p>
                    <h2 id="five">
                        5. Handstand push-ups
                    </h2>
                    <img src="images/article-image-handstand-pushup.jpg"
                        alt="Image of Chris Heria performing a handstand push-up">
                    <p>
                        The final fundamental of mastering your upper body - the handstand push-up. <br><br>Not only is
                        it the last exercise on this list -
                        it's also the third and final direction of the pushing fundamental - Up.<br><br>
                        This is probably the single greatest exercise for getting massive shoulders on a budget.<br><br>
                        And don't forget - your shoulders are a bigger muscle group than your chest - So if you want
                        that V-taper illusion you better get pushing.
                    </p>
