                        Building muscle on a budget: 4 tips to build muscle for poor students
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Training and building your muscles can generally be a costly process: fitness membership,
                        a healthy diet rich in protein, supplements, and potentially equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're on a tight budget it can be hard to piece the puzzle together - That's why I've
                        gathered these four tips to help you build muscle on a budget
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        1. You only need one supplement - Creatine
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Despite what you might read - online you only need a single supplement if you eat a
                        well-balanced, protein-rich diet.<br>
                        That supplement is Creatine Monohydrate, most often just called creatine. There are multiple
                        reasons it's the only supplement you need:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>You don't get the optimal amount of creatine through your diet:</b><br> Most
                                supplements - e.g. protein powder, fish oils, BCAAs,
                                etc. - are unnecessary if you eat a healthy, well-balanced, and protein-rich diet.<br>
                                You normally don't get the optimal
                                amount of creatine through your diet - however healthy your diet may be.<br> It should
                                be said though that if you don't have a good
                                diet - supplements are probably in your best interest.<br><br>

                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Immediate improvement in your muscles by 5% on average:</b><br>
                                In short - creatine allows you to perform more repetitions of your exercises - which in
                                turn allows you to squeeze more
                                out of each workout. <br>Long term muscle improvement has been shown to be as high as
                                between 25-33%.<br>
                                Combine that with the fact that creatine stores itself in your muscles and draws water
                                to them
                                and you have a recipe for aesthetics as well as strength gain.<br><br>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Creatine is cheap as hell:</b><br>
                                You only need 3-5g of creatine a day - and you can get 400-500g of creatine monohydrate
                                powder for 100-150 DKK - many
                                times even less if you keep an eye out for good deals.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>
                        2. Buy frozen goods
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to vegetables you get the exact same - if not more - nutrition from frozen
                        vegetables as you do from fresh vegetables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frozen vegetables are usually much cheaper than fresh vegetables. And they last much longer.
                        This way you save many AND you prevent
                        food waste.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        3. Prep your meals
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Mealprepping (preparing your meals for multiple days in advance) saves you not only money - but
                        also time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you purchase in bulk for multiple meals you typically save money. There's plenty of content
                        on the internet about mealprepping tips.

                    <h2>4. Eat cheap protein sources</h2>
                    <p>
                        You don't have to live off expensive meat to cover your protein needs for optimal protein
                        synthesis. For example: The price of green lentils
                        is much cheaper per gram of protein than - say - cashews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You save a lot of money by going for the cheaper protein sources.<br>
                        Remember - you only need roughly 1.4-2g of protein per kg bodyweight.
